<!--  This code does find the correct change, in the desired obj format with the ability to automatically determine multiple cid amount scenarios
HOWEVER, I had a bug towards the end which did not allow the final obj to be returned to the console to pass the test
ALSO, this is far too long for this problem, but I wanted to stick out the current frame of thinking to find a solution with what I had
I decided to start this project over again, in a new repository, in order to come up with something that is far more concise, too the point, and has less room for bugs to formulate from too much code
-->
this is the final verification project for the JS data structures and algorithms section of FCC
